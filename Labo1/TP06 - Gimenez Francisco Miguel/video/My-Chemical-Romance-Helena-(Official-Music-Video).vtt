00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.700
Long ago

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.600
Just like the hearse you
die to get in again

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.200
We are so far from you

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.800
Burning on

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.100
Just like a match you
strike to incinerate

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.200
The lives of everyone you know

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.900
And what's the worst you
take (Worst you take)

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.800
From every heart you break?
(Heart you break)

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.700
And like the blade you stain
(Blade you stain)

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.550
Well, I've been holding on tonight

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.300
What's the worst that I could say?

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.800
Things are better if I stay

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.400
So long and goodnight

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.450
So long and goodnight

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.200
Came a time

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.000
When every star fall

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.800
Brought you to tears again

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.700
We are the very hurt you sold

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.600
And what's the worst you
take (Worst you take)

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.300
From every heart you break?
(Heart you break)

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.200
And like the blade you stain
(Blade you stain)

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.050
Well, I've been holding on tonight

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.000
What's the worst that I could say?

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.500
Things are better if I stay

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.800
So long and goodnight

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.400
So long and goodnight

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.200
Well, if you carry on this way

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.700
Things are better if I stay

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.100
So long and goodnight

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.250
So long and goodnight

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.700
Can you hear me?

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:23.300
Are you near me?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.100
Can we pretend

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.800
To leave and then

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.400
We'll meet again

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.000
When both our cars collide

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.700
What's the worst that I could say?

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.200
Things are better if I stay

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.600
So long and goodnight

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.200
So long and goodnight

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.800
Well, if you carry on this way

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.500
Things are better if I stay

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.100
So long and goodnight

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.500
So long and goodnight

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:23.500
